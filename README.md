## Velan's ContentEditable Resume Builder - First Internship Project

This project is a web-based resume builder I created during my internship with Coding Raja. It allows users to easily create and edit their resumes directly within the browser using the `contenteditable` attribute. Additionally, it offers a convenient "Click to Download as PDF" feature for exporting the final resume.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Velang2003/Coding-Raja-Technologies-Internship
   ```

2. **Open the Project:**

   Open the `main.html` file in your favorite code editor or web browser.

**Features:**

* **Content Editable Sections:** Edit your resume information directly by clicking on the desired section. Text fields, headings, and sections are all editable.
* **Download as PDF:** Click the "Download as PDF" button to generate a PDF version of your resume. 

**Technology Stack:**

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (For advanced functionalities like download as PDF)

**Note:**

This is a basic implementation of a contenteditable resume builder. You can extend it further by adding features like:

* Pre-defined resume templates
* Section reordering
* Skill and experience input fields

I hope this project serves as a good starting point for my web development journey!

**Further Resources:**

* **Content Editable Attribute:** - contentEditable attribute allows users to click on the text which directly enables the users to type on the template.
* **JavaScript PDF Generation Libraries:** - for download as PDF feature.

**About Coding Raja Internship:**
